    "- what they call share of people is the **normalized percentage** of people. This means that instead of actual percentages, it is on a scale of 1, so **0.33 means 33%**. \n",
    "- This **blurs out**: \n",
    "  - **the total per county**. We just know it was a total of 250,000 interviews, all counties included. We **cannot know** the exact number of **people interviewed per county**.  \n",
    "  Is the timeframe since the beginning of the pandemic ? Daily?  \n",
    "  Needless to also remember that social interactions varied wildly from one individual to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other aspects are not mentioned too: \n",
    "- **indoor or outdoor environments**, it seems both are mixed in here. As we know now, indoor environments are much more critical than outdoor ones.\n",
    "- **age categories**: here too, the older you are the riskier it is for you to be exposed in average\n",
    "- and others like **morbidity, vaccine status, health status**, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lots of data is available and **in the future this study can be extended to more inputs** that could fill the gaps mentioned here. In the Sources parag., we also point out that his dataset is part of a bigger study, so more datasets were collected for it."

    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "To transform raw survey responses into county-level estimates, the survey data was **weighted by age and gender**, and survey **respondents’ locations were approximated from their ZIP codes**. Then **estimates** of mask-wearing were made **for each census tract** by taking a weighted **average of the 200 nearest responses**, with closer responses getting more weight in the average. These tract-level estimates were then rolled up to the county level according to each tract’s total population. \n",
    "\n",
    "By rolling the estimates up to counties, it **reduces a lot of the random noise** that is seen at the tract level."

    "### In Simpler Terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Survey Responses**: a big group of people answered questions about how often they wear masks. These answers are called survey responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weighting by Age and Gender**: To make sure the answers represent everyone fairly, we adjust (or \"weight\") the responses based on how many boys and girls, and different ages there are in the area. **This helps us understand what everyone thinks, not just one group**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using ZIP Codes**: We look at where each person lives using their ZIP code. This **helps us figure out which county they belong to**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finding Estimates for Mask-Wearing**: For each small area (called a census tract), we want to know how many people wear masks. We do this by looking at the 200 closest survey responses. **If someone lives closer to the tract, their answer counts more than someone who is farther away**. It’s like giving a gold star to the kids who live nearby!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rolling Up to County Level:** After we get the mask-wearing estimates for these small areas, we **combine them to get an overall idea for the whole county**. This makes the information clearer and less confusing because it **smooths out any random differences that might happen in smaller areas**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in simple terms: \n",
    "- we take lots of answers, \n",
    "  - adjust them to be fair, \n",
    "  - find out how many people wear masks in small areas, \n",
    "  - and then combine everything to see the bigger picture for the whole county!"
